# DHT22 web service

A small service that allows you to query temperature and humidity readings from a DHT22 sensor running on
a Raspberry Pi. For setup instructions I have used [this tutorial](https://tutorials-raspberrypi.de/raspberry-pi-luftfeuchtigkeit-temperatur-messen-dht11-dht22/) which unfortunately is in German, but you can
fins setup instructions in other languages online.
